    "In this project, we'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. In this course, we'll focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time. To do that, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict if a loan will be paid off or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the datasets themselves, let's get familiar with the data dictionary. The LoanStats sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the RejectStats describes the rejected loans datasets. Since rejected applications don't appear on the Lending Club marketplace and aren't available for investment, we'll be focusing on data on approved loans only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on approved loans data from 2007 to 2011, since a good number of the loans have already finished. In the datasets for later years, many of the loans are current and still being paid off.\n"

    "From the investor's perspective, we're interested in trying to predict which loans will be paid off on time and which ones won't be. Only the Fully Paid and Charged Off values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still on going and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance. \n",

    "Since we're interested in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a binary classification one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either Fully Paid and Charged Off as the loan's status and then transform the Fully Paid values to 1 for the positive case and the Charged Off values to 0 for the negative case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, one thing we need to keep in mind is the class imbalance between the positive and negative cases. While there are 33,136 loans that have been fully paid off, there are only 5,634 that were charged off. This class imbalance is a common problem in binary classification and during training, the model ends up having a strong bias towards predicting the class with more observations in the training set and will rarely predict the class with less observations. The stronger the imbalance, the more biased the model becomes. There are a few different ways to tackle this class imbalance, which we'll explore later."

    "We established that this is a binary classification problem in the first mission of this course, and we converted the loan_status column to 0s and 1s as a result. Before diving in and selecting an algorithm to apply to the data, we should select an error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're primarily concerned with false positives and false negatives. Both of these are different types of misclassifications. With a false positive, we predict that a loan will be paid off on time, but it actually isn't. This costs us money, since we fund loans that lose us money. With a false negative, we predict that a loan won't be paid off on time, but it actually would be paid off on time. This loses us potential money, since we didn't fund a loan that actually would have been paid off.\n",

    "Since we're viewing this problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor, we need to treat false positives differently than false negatives. A conservative investor would want to minimize risk, and avoid false positives as much as possible. They'd be more okay with missing out on opportunities (false negatives) than they would be with funding a risky loan (false positives).\n",

    "Lastly, there's a class imbalance in our target column, loan_status. There are about 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (positive case, label of 1) than those that weren't (negative case, label of 0). Imbalances can cause issues with many machine learning algorithms, where they appear to have high accuracy, but actually aren't learning from the training data. Because of its potential to cause issues, we need to keep the class imbalance in mind as we build machine learning models.\n",

    "As expected, even though we're not using accuracy as an error metric, the classifier is, and it isn't accounting for the imbalance in the classes. There are a few ways to get a classifier to correct for imbalanced classes. The two main ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use oversampling and undersampling to ensure that the classifier gets input that has a balanced number of each class.\n",
    "- Tell the classifier to penalize misclassifications of the less prevalent class more than the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oversampling and undersampling involves taking a sample that contains equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0, and where loan_status is 1. This way, the classifier is forced to make actual predictions, since predicting all 1s or all 0s will only result in 50% accuracy at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this technique is that since it has to preserve an equal ratio, you have to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Throw out many rows of data. If we wanted equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0 and where loan_status is 1, one way we could do that is to delete rows where loan_status is 1.\n",
    "- Copy rows multiple times. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to copy rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "- Generate fake data. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to generate new rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, none of these techniques are especially easy. The second method we mentioned earlier, telling the classifier to penalize certain rows more, is actually much easier to implement using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process. The penalty means that the logistic regression classifier pays more attention to correctly classifying rows where loan_status is 0. This lowers accuracy when loan_status is 1, but raises accuracy when loan_status is 0. This would mean that for the classifier, correctly classifying a row where loan_status is 0 is 6 times more important than correctly classifying a row where loan_status is 1."
