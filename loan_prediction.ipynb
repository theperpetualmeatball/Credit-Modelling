    "In this course, we will walk through the full data science life cycle, from data cleaning and feature selection to machine learning. We will focus on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. In this course, we'll focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time. To do that, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict if a loan will be paid off or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the datasets themselves, let's get familiar with the data dictionary. The LoanStats sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the RejectStats describes the rejected loans datasets. Since rejected applications don't appear on the Lending Club marketplace and aren't available for investment, we'll be focusing on data on approved loans only.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on approved loans data from 2007 to 2011, since a good number of the loans have already finished. In the datasets for later years, many of the loans are current and still being paid off.\n"

    "From the investor's perspective, we're interested in trying to predict which loans will be paid off on time and which ones won't be. Only the Fully Paid and Charged Off values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still on going and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're interested in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a binary classification one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either Fully Paid and Charged Off as the loan's status and then transform the Fully Paid values to 1 for the positive case and the Charged Off values to 0 for the negative case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, one thing we need to keep in mind is the class imbalance between the positive and negative cases. While there are 33,136 loans that have been fully paid off, there are only 5,634 that were charged off. This class imbalance is a common problem in binary classification and during training, the model ends up having a strong bias towards predicting the class with more observations in the training set and will rarely predict the class with less observations. The stronger the imbalance, the more biased the model becomes. There are a few different ways to tackle this class imbalance, which we'll explore later."
